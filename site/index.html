        <div class="text">
            Proportional Representation Toronto is a group of people working on the promotion of proportional representation in the city of Toronto.  If you want to do this you are invited and encouraged to attend the founding meeting.
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            There is a proposal on the table for adopting at a founding meeting.
        </div>

        <h2 aria-role="heading">The Proposal</h2>

        <div class="text">
            The basic idea of the proposal is to elect a council for each ward using STV.
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            The Ward Councils would consist of 4-6 elected members plus the City Councillor as chair.  These councils would rule on very local issues.
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            There are extensions to the basic idea.  Community Councils would consist of joint meetings of the relevant Ward Councils.  An annual Grand Council could convene to consider large, long range issues like transit planning.
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            Note:  This proposal does not change anything about the current method of electing City Councillors.
        </div>

        <h2 aria-role="heading">Founding Meeting</h2>

        <div class="text">
            The founding meeting is proposed to take place in the latter half of January.  Please fill out this <a href="https://doodle.com/poll/3xmiddrtqewbd8id?utm_source=poll&utm_medium=link">Doodle</a> with your availability.
