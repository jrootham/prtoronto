        <h2 id="problems" aria-role="heading">The Problems</h2>

        <div class="text">
            There are a number of problems with governance of the City of Toronto which have their origin in problems of representation.  Amongst the representation problems are:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Not enough representatives.

                    <div class="text">
                        The total number of representatives is simply too small for the population of Toronto.
                    </div>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Insufficiently diverse representation.

                    <div class="text">
                        The representatives we do have do not adequately reflect the diversity of Toronto.
                    </div>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Stagnant representation.

                    <div class="text">
                        The incumbency advantage is large enough that councillors seldom lose elections even as the circumstances that got them first elected change.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lack of representation choice.

                    <div class="text">
                        In the case of conflicts within a ward, single member wards make it impossible for different sides to have representation.
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="text">
                All of these problems have been made worse by the Ford government's interference in Toronto elections.  Given that a Provincial election is coming up we should have alternatives available for discussion during the election campaign.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2 aria-role="heading">The Proposal</h2>

        <div class="text">
            The basic idea of the proposal is to elect a council for each ward using Single Transferable Vote (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote">STV</a>), a proportional electoral system.
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            The Ward Councils would consist of 4-6 elected members plus the City Councillor as chair.  In a well developed and established version of this proposal these Councils would rule on very local issues.  In the beginning they will provide reports to Council for adoption.  In any event, they will be in a position to provide advice to Council on a broad range of issues.
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            This proposal would elect more representatives.  STV is known to produce more diverse results.  Ward councillors will eventually gather enough support to challenge sitting councillors.  There will be multiple councillors in each ward for disputants to chose from.
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            There are extensions to the basic idea.  Community Councils would consist of joint meetings of the relevant Ward Councils. Issues on boundaries could be dealt with with ad hoc joint meetings. An annual Grand Council could convene to consider large, long range issues like transit planning.
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            Some questions have arisen:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <div class="text">
                        What is local?  A preliminary list for discussion.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Parking</li>
                            <li>Tree removal permits</li>
                            <li>Traffic calming</li>
                            <li>Liquor licenses</li>
                            <li>Small development</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </li>

                <li class="major">
                    It should be implemented in all wards.  Preferably (eventually) through provincial legislation that marks out what is local.
                </li>

                <li class="major">
                    Ward councillors should be paid, not necessarily at full time rates.
                </li>

                <li class="major">
                    There should be staff to provide administrative support and give public access to a contact person during the day.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            Note:  This proposal does not change anything about the current method of electing City Councillors.  If it is adopted as advisory bodies their powers will not change.  If the province gives the Ward Council powers the Council powers will change.
